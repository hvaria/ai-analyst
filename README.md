# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Configuration

## Setting Up the .env File

To run the application correctly, you need to set up environment variables:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of your project.
2. **Add the following line to the `.env` file**:
   ```plaintext
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# Specific Requirements for the Profit and Loss Statement

This application is designed to work with a specific format of the Profit and Loss (P&L) statement. Ensure your P&L statement adheres to the following structure:

- **Format**: Must be in a `.csv` format
- **Columns**: Date, Category, Revenue, Expenses, Net Profit
- **Data Formatting**: Ensure that the data is formatted consistently (e.g., dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format)

## Acceptable Input Format

- **Screenshot Requirements**: The application only accepts screenshots of the P&L statements. Ensure that the screenshots are clear and legible, covering all required columns (Date, Category, Revenue, Expenses, Net Profit). Unsupported file types or improperly formatted screenshots will not be processed correctly by the application.
